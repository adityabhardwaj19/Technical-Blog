    <p>
        I'm going to show you guys how to create an awesome intro
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I'm gonna show you guys a really simple one with like an explosion your name and some music you can hang so I'm gonna show you how to do that right now in this video make sure the smell up and I'm already and I'll say it let's get
started okay so as you can see we are on
Vegas  as always and the first thing
that you guys need to do is to download
a few things I'm gonna show you guys
what you guys need to download so
basically I'm gonna open up this folder
this is what you're going to need and
you're gonna disregard the thumbnail but
the thing you need is an explosion with
on green screen a song with a recognized
a copyright free song with like a nice
job for example NCS and a sound effect
explosions so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna make her name zoom in and
when my you know my name is fully zoomed
we're gonna make an explosion as a music
geek a name it's gonna be really Austin
I would say let's go ahead and start off
with dragging everything into the
project okay so as you can see we have
our explosion right here so the next
thing I'm gonna do is we're gonna also
drag in or song by NCS it is the edge as
you can see right here our boom sound
effects so now we're gonna now that we
have everything right here the only
thing we're gonna just move those aside
for a second and we're gonna make her
name zoom in really fast and then boom
when my name is like fully soon we're
gonna make some explosions so the first
thing you need to do is we go over media
generators and you're going to pick
titles and text so we're gonna place
this guy onto the timeline and we're
gonna just write our name it's really
simple so I'm just gonna type in just I
solve it in my case I'm gonna do it like
this boom and as you can see it's a
little bit too big so I'm gonna make
this I would say  looks great then
we're gonna pick a nice different fonts
of course because this one looks like a
little bit standards so we're gonna go
ahead and find a nice like fancy artsy
fartsy font I think this one looks
pretty nice so we're gonna exit this out
and right here we have her name but we
need to make make this zoom so it's
gonna be really simple you would own the
only thing you need to do
if you went over to this little icon
this event pan/crop  and the first
thing you want to do is when you open up
this box first thing you want to do if
you just want to zoom out as much as you
can by dragging this bear so it's so it
looks really tiny so now that we have
zoomed like out as much as we can we're
gonna place a keyframe and you can do
that just by clicking somewhere on the
on the little on the brighter bar not
this one with this one and you're not
saying I'm going to place the keyframe
right here and then we're gonna go ahead
and zoom in to the original size or just
restore box now that we made a movement
from small to big so this is what the
movement looks like as you can see it's
zooming in really slow but you can also
make it faster by just going back and
just drag this keyframe you made closer
to the to the beginning so let's see
what it looks like right now dish and
the next thing we're going to do is
we're gonna make this explosion they
like explode when my name appear is like
boom on screen so we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a new video track
right click and search video track I'm
going to drag this explosion over or
text file and I can already hear guys
like dude why is it green and not only
the explosion when you want to use a
chroma key actually the carbon key that
I use as well you know different for my
green screens it works the same so we go
over to video effects obviously you want
to pick a chroma key this one drag it on
top of there and then you want to take
the same color but there's no way you're
gonna go ahead and like start matching
those colors no you just want to pick
this little pencil click once on the
green and boom we have our explosion
right there only has a little bit too
greenish you know like over so I'm gonna
just you know play with the low
threshold for a second until it looks
good right it looks good so let's see
how it looks right now and you can see
it appears a little bit too too early so
I'm going to drag this one to the right
and let's match it do hours later so I
timed it a little bit and this is big
it's gonna hold how good it looks
let's see boom but what you can also can
do is you can cut a little bit way away
I like to like shorten the explosion
until you can see until you see like
this one boom so let's just go ahead and
match those two when it's zoom in boom
the explosion is there the next thing
that we're gonna do is you can also make
a little bit bigger guy so I'm gonna
mention that you're gonna go over t
this track motion icon on the track of
your explosion and you just whipping that
makeup go ahead and start dragging this
a little bit bigger or right here that
looks pretty good you can also add a
little bright and contrast to it so
video effects brightness and contrast
drag this one on top of your you know
your explosion and you can just go ahead
and master on with the contrast just
spice it up a little but it looks pretty
good actually so this is basically how
it looks so far boom
we have my name and then the next thing
we're gonna do is we're gonna match the
music on there so I'm gonna turn on my
headset because there's audio let's go
ahead and pick the track and let's see
where the drop is of the music so I'm
going to cut away until it drops let's
see maybe a little bit loud let me lower
a bit let's get here comes a drop okay so
we're gonna cut away this parts pressing
s delete this one and I'm gonna match
this with my name so let's see how it
looks a little bit too late so we're
gonna cut away right there so this is
our intro and I think eight seconds for
intros like the perfect length so I'm
gonna just drag my text a little bit to
the end unless say I'm gonna just make
my make my text fade out
I'm gonna do it like this you can
believe this explosion how it is and
then also we're gonna add this explosion
sound effect this one just you know
appear also on the same moments that
think that that explosion is kicking in
so let's see what it sounds like let's
match those that's pretty good actually
guys so obviously you can add in like
different backgrounds when when the
music kicks in you can add like a like a
background you know for me in my case
this is just like a black background
let's see if I can find something else like let's say I'm gonna pick a gradient that I'm gonna drag this one right here and let me place this one so you can add and look at background like a light leak particles vignette colors anything that is how awesome it is so that's how you make a cool intro and obviously I know there are so many different ways to create other cool intros I know but make sure to stay tuned
